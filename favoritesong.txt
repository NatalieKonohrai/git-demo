We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

Paint my nails cherry red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
